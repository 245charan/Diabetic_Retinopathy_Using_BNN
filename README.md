# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Using_BNN

Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness and eye disease in working age population of developed world. However the state-of-the-art techniques of deep learning modelsâ€™ computation cost is expensive and consumes large amount of space. To apply these models to low computing devices is challenging task. To address this problem Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) could be best possible solution under research. BNNs have the ability to reduce the memory utilization and computational complexity of the neural network.
